# Welcome to Kim Phuong's blog :tada:

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...Nothing. I'm just learning to use gitHub.
I've just download _Blue Stack_ and run _Rosetta Stone_ on it :relaxed:
These are apk apps that I've install in _Blue Stack_:
* Zing MP3
* Rosetta Stone
* Japanese Alphabet
